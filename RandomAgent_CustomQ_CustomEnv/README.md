# Custom Q_function , Not Deep With Custom Environment

### Q_function,Parameterized

- *we create custom Env*

- *we parameterized Q_function just with 3 params,check it in notebook*

- *we are trying to learn theta parameter with q_learning (or minimizing td loss) methods also for stabilize learning process will use experience replay*

- *The initial point for theta is [0,0,0],plus we use torch tensor with cuda enabled ,for calculate gradient in gpu*
